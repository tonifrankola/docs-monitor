### Download Custom Reports

This dialog enables you to download and import the **predefined Custom Reports** from SysKit’s **repository**. There, you can find around **twenty** custom reports created for various purposes and categorized by the data type they display. It is very important to read the report description on the right side.

If you select a report from the list, the following report information will be displayed:

* **Name** – the name of the report.
* **Description** – the description of the report. It is very important to read the description, as it may clarify the purpose of the report.
* **Version** – reports can be changed and updated with more advanced functionality by our product team.
* **Author** – the name of the author.
* **Date Published** – the date when the report was published.

Depending on which tab is selected, the available options change their purpose:

* **Search box** – Use this option to search through the available reports. The report description will also be included if it matches the entered criteria.
* **Online tab** – Displays reports that are ready for installation.
* **Installed tab** – Displays a list of reports that are already installed. If you want to remove installed reports, just select them and click the Remove button. Afterwards, the report\(s\) will be deleted.
* **Updates tab** – Displays a list of reports that have been updated by our product team. If you want to update installed reports, just select them and click the **Update** button. Afterward, the report\(s\) will be replaced with new ones, but all the previously defined user settings will **not be kept** for both normal and SQL types.

When downloading available custom reports, simply select the reports and click the **Install** button. After the custom reports have been downloaded, the success dialog will appear, informing you that the reports have been installed. The reports will also appear in the left navigation within their corresponding folder structure.
