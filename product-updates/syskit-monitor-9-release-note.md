### SysKit’s Features

#### Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops support

+ Citrix Virtual Desktops are now __fully supported__ in SysKit Monitor.
+ The reports within SysKit Monitor are designed to make it as easy as possible for you to take control of and simplify the reporting and management of your Citrix environment.
+ SysKit Monitor automatically detects Citrix servers and starts collecting data for all your Virtual Apps and Desktops. Simply go through the Add Computers Wizard in just a few steps!
+ All your Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops names will be resolved to their __published names__ and displayed in SysKit Monitor. Discover who is using Citrix Virtual Apps and Desktops in your environment and for how long.

#### Windows Server 2019 support

+ We have been consistently testing Windows Server 2019 throughout the development cycle. This SysKit Monitor release will support Windows Server 2019 from __Day One__.
+ Add your Windows Server 2019 VMs using the Add Computers Wizard and browse through the numerous reports in SysKit Monitor.

#### Remote Desktop web client support

+ SysKit Monitor has supported Microsoft’s native Remote Desktop client ever since it was created in 2008. Now you can monitor and keep track of __browser-based Web client__ sessions. 
+ Easily discover who’s remotely accessing applications hosted in your environment using the RD Web client. Browse the numerous reports in SysKit Monitor and filter out different client names.

### Improvements

+ We have optimized our code and data collection for Citrix servers. Now it works better and faster while communicating with the underlying Citrix infrastructure.
+ The __Connection Type__ filter in the reports has been completely redesigned. Now it includes __six__ different connection types for filtering user sessions: __RDP, Citrix, Citrix Published Apps, Citrix Published Desktops, Disconnected__ and __Console__.

### Bug Fixes

+ The __Applications__ filter in SysKit Monitor web application was not filtering out selected entries properly when exporting reports.
+ __Data Collectors__ were sometimes displayed as ‘Offline’ in both the Manage Data Collectors dialog and the global warning bar, if the data collection process was taking too long.
