### Adding new computers

This wizard screen also shows the number of remaining monitoring licenses.

4. The **License Summary** step shows the number of computers that will be added and the remaining licenses. Click **Next >** to proceed.
5. In the **Adding Computers** step, a computer status check will be performed for a list of selected computers. This functionality will provide you with more information about possible misconfigurations if the load finishes with warnings or errors.
   > **Please note!** Your computers will be added regardless of the listed warnings or errors!

   The **Status** column will contain a link to our help page if warnings or errors occur. If you click on the link, you will be guided through the process on how to **resolve** the Offline and Unauthorized computer states.  
   When the load is finished, you will have an option to save the warnings or errors that occurred to a **log file** in a .pdf or excel format.  
   Click **Close** to exit the wizard. Afterward, a list of added computers will appear.

### Adding new computers manually
