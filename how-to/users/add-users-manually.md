## Give access to SysKit Monitor users who haven't connected previously to the monitored computers

If you want to give access to SysKit Monitor to one user, please follow these instructions:
1. In **Manage Users and Groups** dialog click the arrow by the **Grant Access** button and then click the **Grant Access Manually** button. In the Create new user dialog, enter information about the user you want to give access to SysKit Monitor.

1. Under **Security – Role** select **Viewer**. This user will now have rights to read the data and to use SysKit Monitor to view reports.

1. If you give someone the **Administrator** role, they will also be able to administer the database and will have a full permission to use the SysKit Monitor.

If you want to give access to SysKit Monitor to a whole group, please follow these instructions:
1. **In Manage Users and Groups** click on the **Security and distribution groups**.

1. Select the group you want and click **Edit**.

1. In tab Members you can see all the users that are members of this specific group.

1. Change **Security – Role** to **Administrator** and click **OK**.

>_**Please note!**_ *A new security group will be added as soon as the first user from it is connected to the computer and recognized by SysKit Monitor. It is **not possible** to add anyone manually to the group, SysKit Monitor will do it automatically. Also, now you can give Administrator role to the whole group.*
