This article explains how to configure report subscriptions. 

In order to be able to schedule a report first you need to [configure E-mail settings](#internal/get-to-know-syskit-monitor/backstage-screen/configuration/options/#send-e-mails).

1. Open the report you want to subscribe to and click on the **Schedule This Report** button from the **Reports** ribbon.
2. In the **New Subscription** dialog, enter the following information:
   * Subscription Name
   * Select Delivery Methods you want to apply to your subscription. Available options are: __Email, File Share,__ and __SharePoint__.
   * Email delivery settings which include: the e-mail addresses of the recipients, the email subject and body text.
   * Delivery period:
       - **Daily** – report will be sent on Every X day(s) or Every Workday.
       - **Weekly** – report will be sent on the preferred day of each week.
       - **Monthly** – report will be sent on the preferred day of each month.
       - **Quarterly** – report will be sent on the preferred day of each quarter.
3. Click on the **Reports** tab in the New Subscription dialog. Here you can:
    * see the list of reports added to this subscription
    * add another __Report__ to this subscription
    * add __Custom Report__ to this subscription
    * add __PowerShell Report__ to this subscription
    * edit previously added report
    * delete added report
    * combine reports into a single PDF file – if there is more than one scheduled report
    * compress report(s) into a single .zip file.
4. Double click on the listed report to change its settings. Here you can:
    * set missing values because all filters must be properly defined
    * readjust the report filters
    * change the report name
    * choose the subscription format – PDF, XLS, XLSX
    * change the report layout
5. Click __Save & Close__ to finish creating this subscription.
